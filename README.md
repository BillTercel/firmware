# Firmware for VIA

1. Right-click the link to the firmware and select "Save link as.." to download the firmware file.

2. Install using your favorite flashing tool, such as QMK Toolbox, dfu-programmer, Atmel Flip, etc. Note that in many cases, you can hold down the top left key of your keyboard when inserting USB plug to put the PCB into "bootloader mode".

3. After flashing new firmware, restart the firmware application inside the flashing tool, or just unplug and plug USB.

4. VIA should detect your keyboard and display the default layout.
